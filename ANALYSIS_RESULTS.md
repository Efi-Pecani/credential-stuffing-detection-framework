# Credential Stuffing Attack Analysis: Key Findings

This document summarizes the key findings from our analysis of login attempt data to detect credential stuffing attacks. The analysis focuses on identifying patterns, sources, and techniques used in credential stuffing attempts.

## 1. Attack Patterns Overview

### Temporal Patterns
- **Suspicious Activity Bursts**: Notable activity bursts were identified at specific times (04:01-04:06, 04:13-04:23, 04:28-04:43)
- **Non-Human Activity Patterns**: Several IP addresses showed login attempt frequencies inconsistent with human behavior
- **Time-of-Day Anomalies**: Unusual activity concentrations outside of normal business hours

### Geographic Distribution
- **Unusual Origin Countries**: Significant suspicious activity originated from Seychelles (SC) and South Africa (ZA)
- **Country-Tool Correlations**: Specific combinations of countries and tools showed higher risk patterns
- **Unexpected Traffic Sources**: Certain countries showed disproportionate login attempt volumes relative to expected customer base

### Technical Indicators
- **Status Code Anomalies**: Unusual concentrations of 504 (Gateway Timeout), 413 (Request Entity Too Large), and 400 (Bad Request) status codes
- **Network Type Patterns**: Substantial suspicious activity originated from 'hosted' network types
- **Tool Usage Patterns**: Several tool IDs showed usage patterns consistent with automated credential stuffing tools

## 2. Attack Sources Profile

### Suspicious IP Addresses
The following hashed IP addresses showed particularly anomalous behavior:
- `51055ebb57524aadbe9bafddbef1b6bb`: Extremely high velocity login attempts between 04:01-04:06
- `3027a291b4cc71d5e5e1b5e54f5c4e9a`: Multiple batched attempts with consistent timing patterns
- `b903208e2adbe7412c1ce954d3d66ec6`: Similar patterns to known attack tools
- `93bf1dc7fa0e09b47585623bdf23f297`: Non-human login velocity and timing

### Tool Analysis
Several tools were identified as likely being used for credential stuffing:
- Tool ID `0940ea46bcf557f5`: Associated with multiple suspicious login attempts
- Tool ID `5280136f5f66ec7b`: Unusual usage patterns inconsistent with legitimate login behavior
- Tool ID `79152d70d09b44e9`: High frequency of use from suspicious IP addresses
- Tool ID `5ca7de1b8c611402`: Correlation with known suspicious network types

### Network Analysis
Network types and IDs showing suspicious patterns:
- Network Type: 'hosted' networks showed significantly higher risk indicators
- Multiple network IDs were associated with suspicious activity, suggesting potential use of cloud or VPN services to mask attack origins

## 3. Attack Methodology Analysis

### Login Attempt Velocity
- The highest risk login attempts showed velocities exceeding 0.02 attempts per second from a single IP
- Many suspicious IPs maintained consistent login attempt rates over extended periods
- Burst patterns show evidence of programmatic throttling to avoid basic rate limiting

### Target Selection
- Analysis suggests attackers are using systematic credential stuffing rather than targeted account attacks
- Email hash patterns suggest attackers possess a pre-compiled list of potential credentials
- No clear pattern of specific user targeting was identified

### Technical Approach
- Status code patterns suggest attackers are using automation tools with minimal error handling
- Evidence of multiple concurrent attack sessions from different IP addresses
- Some attack patterns show signs of proxy rotation or distributed attack infrastructure

## 4. Compromised Credentials

The analysis identified a set of email hashes with high likelihood of compromise based on:
1. Successful login attempts from suspicious IP addresses
2. Multiple login attempts across known malicious infrastructure
3. Anomalous login patterns inconsistent with legitimate user behavior

These accounts should be prioritized for security review and potential password resets.

## 5. Risk Metrics

The detection methodology achieved the following performance metrics when compared to existing risk indicators:
- Accuracy: Moderate alignment with existing risk flags
- Additional Detection: Identified suspicious patterns not caught by existing indicators
- False Positives: Limited false positive rate based on manual review

## 6. Recommended Actions

Based on this analysis, we recommend:

### Immediate Actions
1. Force password resets for all accounts identified in the compromised credentials list
2. Implement temporary blocks for the identified suspicious IP addresses
3. Review applications using the flagged tool IDs for potential security issues

### Short-term Improvements
1. Implement rate limiting based on the identified attack velocities
2. Add additional verification steps for logins from high-risk countries
3. Enhance monitoring for the specific status code patterns identified

### Long-term Strategy
1. Consider implementing CAPTCHA or other bot prevention measures
2. Develop baseline behavioral models for login attempts to improve anomaly detection
3. Implement multi-factor authentication to mitigate credential stuffing risks
4. Create a continuous monitoring system using the patterns identified in this analysis

This analysis provides a foundation for both immediate response and ongoing protection against credential stuffing attacks. The patterns identified should be incorporated into security monitoring systems for enhanced detection capabilities.
